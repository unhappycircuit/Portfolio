        Unhappy Circuit is a new media artist in Korea. 
        His work is based on a fusion of art, science, technology and multidisciplinary perspective that encompasses 
        linguistics, anthropology, ecology, futurology, and cosmology.
        <br><br>
        The pursuit of his art is "the connection between man and the universe." 
        He wants to expand our perception of the universe and humanity through his art, 
        and to connect our human lives and minds, which are essentially finite and lonely, with the vast universe.
        <br><br>
        He has participated in various exhibitions hosted by art institutions such as 
        Hyundai Motor Group's ZER01NE, Asia Culture Center, Arts Council Korea, C-LAB(Taiwan), BeFantastic(India), ARCOLABS(Indonesia).

        <1 HUMAN MASSAGE> links cosmic time and the time of an one ordinary human on the Earth. 
        And Unhappy Circuit sends it into space. It is the effort to reach the furthest universe as a human being, 
        to expand the meaning of all human lives, minds, and existence that originated in the universe but were disconnected from the universe, 
        and to form a cosmic connection between all isolated, finite, and lonely beings in the universe beyond cosmic silence.

      <P>
        Language interacts with the way of thinking, emotion and culture of the beings who use it. This means that language is the most important thing for mutual understanding. 
        <br><br>
        This series of works is the process of designing and developing the interstellar message, 
        which contains structured information about human language and civilization for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. 
        In particular, in order to reflect the diversity and uniqueness of the human languages, 
        This series continuously expands interest to the languages of the marginalized world.
        <br><br>
        In addition, These works convey the message of Earth’s climate change to the universe. 
        This message, which symbolizes the present of humanity, forms a consensus between the two civilizations living in this universe, 
        while transforming our own view of ourselves into cosmic perspective. These interstellar messages are an echo of the universe toward ourselves.

  <h2>3. Series of Artificial Intelligence, 2018~2019</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="text-container">
      <P>
        Between 2018 and 2019, the Unhappy Circuit focused on artificial intelligence as a major theme and medium for his work. He divides artificial intelligence into three big perspectives: artificial intelligence as a new human being, artificial intelligence as a technology that complements humans, and artificial intelligence as a mirror that reflects humans.
        <br><br>
        First of all, artificial intelligence as a new human being literally means artificial intelligence as a new intellectual being that has evolved into a human-like or transcending human beings. In other words, it means artificial intelligence as a true posthuman. On the other hand, artificial intelligence as a technology that complements humans refers to the perspective of recognizing artificial intelligence as a new technological tool. While the previous view is based on futuristic perspective, the latter is the perspective of artificial intelligence in the present era. Finally, artificial intelligence as a mirror that reflects humans is a humanistic or artistic perspective of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is learning about humanity through data. The results generated by such artificial intelligence reveal nature of humanity. 
        <br><br>
        After all, for the Unhappy Circuit, artificial intelligence is a technology that has the potential to become a new human being someday, and a technology that has the greatest impact on our lives at the moment, and an artistic medium that reflects nature of our humanity.

        Whales, like humans, can feel and express emotions, live in a complex society, and have a language system for communication. In addition, Whales have evolved together by sharing an ancestor with all mammals on the Earth, including humans. However, humans have long threatened the survival of whales, which still persists nowadays.
        <br><br>
        This work is an attempt to create music that whales and humans can listen to and interact with by converging blue whale vocalization and human music using artificial intelligence. Through this attempt, the work depicts the future in which whales and humans understand each other and coexist together.
        <br><br>
        Through the life and death of whales, we can face the true nature of humanity. This is not irrelevant to the numerous tragedies in human history that have occurred without understanding each other and the current situation of human civilization that still lives with the potential to destroy ourselves.

        Chickens that are slaughtered about 65 billion a year, are considered a symbol of the Anthropocene. As the era of abundance due to the industrialization of livestock breeding and slaughter continues, we also forget that the meat we commonly encounter in our daily lives was once a living creature. In particular, despite occurring in the process of rearing and slaughtering livestock, uncomfortable truths that we have been trying to ignore makes us ask ourselves questions about humanity.
        <br><br>
        Artificial intelligence learns human beings through massive amounts of data, and the result reflects humanity like a mirror. After all, the chicken dish generated by artificial intelligence is the mirror for humanity that reveals the true nature of humanity behind the abundance of modern human civilization.

        For humans, memory means our own identity. Losing my memories is like losing myself. Memories are our lives. However, human memory is very incomplete. Therefore, humans have recorded and preserved their memories on various media to compensate for the imperfections of biological memory. From prehistoric cave murals to computer memory, humans are rapidly evolving by expanding the brain's area of storing memories to new media with the advancement of technology. 
        <br><br>
        Now, the memory extends to artificial intelligence. Are there indescribable features that only the moments of experiences have in memories? Or are memories just data that can be copied and transmitted all the time? If memories are just data, Is it possible for artificial intelligence to learn human memories? If it is possible for artificial intelligence to learn human memories, would artificial intelligence that learned my memories be me? 
        <br><br>
        In this work, artificial intelligence learns the memory of a one person's mother and generates new images and sounds. Whose memory is the generated audio visual sequence?

        Morse code and computer logic systems have similarities in terms of decoding information in binary. In particular, Morse code, which digitizes human language, becomes a medium language that connects computer and human languages. 
        <br><br>
        In this work the human language digitized with Morse code is transformed into a computer's memory process by programmed audiovisual algorithms. And it gradually evolves to human memory. 
        <br><br>
        In other words this work closely connects language, code, memory and data, and human and computer by dismantling the boundaries between human and computer through Morse code.

        ＜Just Waiting for a Happy Ending＞은 2014년에 발표된 언해피서킷의 데뷔앨범이다. 이 시기의 그의 음악은 ‘우울한 기계소년의 감정’을 글리치, 노이즈 사운드로 표현한 것으로, ‘언해피서킷'이라는 그의 이름 역시 이와 연관된다.
        <br><br>
        특히 그는 이 앨범에서 ‘글리치’라는 실험적 사운드 테크닉을 고독, 슬픔, 우울과 같은 정서와 연결하여 하나의 서사적 완결성을 지닌 음악으로 완성하는데 집중하였다. 이는 마치 차가운 기계에 인간의 감정을 심는 과정이었으며, 고장난 내면의 소리를 온전히 담아내기 위한 치열한 노력이었다.
        <br><br>
        “소음, 곧 음악으로서는 꽤 낯선 새로운 소리들은 청각의 긴장감을 바짝 조인다. ‘음(音)’이 ‘악(樂)’이 될 수 있는 까닭은 서사의 상존 덕이다. 단음계를 오고가는 느릿한 건반 음뿐만이 아니라 작은 배경음마저 고저장단의 미세한 조율을 거침으로써, 피로하지 않은 흐름을 만들어낸다.” - 정병욱, 음악취향Y 에디터
        <br><br>
        “글리치한 사운드와 파시식하는 노이즈 사이에서도 명료한 건반음이 당신의 감수성 안에 끊임없이 개입하겠다는 의지를 잃지 않는다. 군데군데 절단되어 있고, 훼손된 듯 보이지만 여전히 듣는(보는) 이의 집중력을 놓지 못하게 만든다. 섹스도 있고 멜랑콜리도 있다. 온건한 음악이자 좋은 음악이다.” - 박병운, 음악취향Y 에디터
